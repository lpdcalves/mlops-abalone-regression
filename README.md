# MLOps CNN Image Classification

## Introduction

This is a simple project that aims to built image classification with the MLOps best practices for training and deployment of models in production.

## About the dataset

The dataset is a collection of Natural Scenes around the world and is available at kaggle [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
This database contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
