# MLOps Regression using Abalone's Shell Data

## Introduction

This project aims to build an MLOps pipeline capable of training and deploying a regression model that determines an Abalone's age based on its characteristics.
An Abalone is a shelled marine mollusc, consumed as food by a variety of cultures around the world.

## About the dataset

The dataset is a collection of measurements from Abalone specimens and is available at kaggle: [Abalone Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset).
Precisely determining the age of an Abalone specimen is a difficult and time consuming task, so being able to estimate it using machine learning methods is a desireable solution. Therefore, this dataset contains a little over 4000 entries with the length, height, weight etc of the Abalone. Below there is an extensive list of parameters from the dataset.

```yml
    - sex
    - length
    - diameter
    - height
    - whole weight
    - shucked weight
    - viscera weight
    - shell weight
    - rings
```
