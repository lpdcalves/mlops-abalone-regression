# MLOps Regression using Abalone's Shell Data

## Introduction

This project aims to build an MLOps pipeline capable of training and deploying a regression model that determines an Abalone's age based on its characteristics.
An Abalone is a shelled marine mollusc, consumed as food by a variety of cultures around the world.

## About the dataset

The dataset is a collection of measurements from Abalone specimens and is available at kaggle [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset).
This database contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
